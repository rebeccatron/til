# TIL: Tracking what I learned today

Since I got started as a software engineer in 2015, I have learned a LOT. Every day, from nearly every person I've worked with, across technical domains and stacks.

...the thing is, I'm not always so great at capturing my own learning and putting it *somewhere* I can easily share or refer to later.

So, I'm giving this a whirl! Inspired by [Simon Willison's](https://til.simonwillison.net) TILs, which in turn is inspired by [Josh Branchaud's TILs](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), described as:

> A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post.

This is a handy definition, as I have consistently proven incapable of maintaining a collection of full blog posts lol ðŸ˜°
